This is my [personal website](https://bhlmn.github.io/). It is generated using <a href = "https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll">knitr-jekyll</a> with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). I create all of my posts with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

A big help in getting the website going was [this site](https:homerhanumat.github.io/knitr-hyde).
