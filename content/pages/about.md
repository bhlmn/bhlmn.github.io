I'm a meteorologist turned data scientist. 

In [graduate school](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bryan-Holman) I studied how feature engineering and machine learning could improve wind forecastsâ€“picking up Python, R, SQL, and data science along the way.

After graduate school I joined [Kyruus Health](https://kyruushealth.com/), where I dove into data engineering, the cloud (GCP and AWS), [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), and people/project leadership.

Currently I'm an AI Architect and Engineer at [Insight](https://www.insight.com/), where I design and build AI/ML-powered applications.

From five to nine I'm spending time with my amazing family, working out, playing sports, listening to instrumental rock, drumming, and enjoying all the Pacific Northwest has to offer.
