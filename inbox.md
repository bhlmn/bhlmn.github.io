Here is where I put a collection of notes I want to remember.

## Health

* To decrease risks associated with poor posture, take walking breaks every 20 to 30 minutes (Pomodoro, anyone?). Regularly incorporate strength training exercies that target the shoulders and back into your exercise routine ([Heid 2019](https://elemental.medium.com/good-posture-matters-even-more-than-you-think-fac02fd575ad)).
* Perform a mix of static and dynamic stretching as part of warming up before exercise. Daily static stretching activities (such as yoga) increase flexibility and aid in improving physical performance ([Roy Britt 2019](https://elemental.medium.com/does-stretching-do-any-good-ec085a8ddd90)).
