Here is where I put a collection of notes I want to remember.

## Health

* To decrease risks associated with poor posture, take walking breaks every 20 to 30 minutes (Pomodoro, anyone?). Regularly incorporate strength training exercies that target the shoulders and back into your exercise routine ([Heid 2019](https://elemental.medium.com/good-posture-matters-even-more-than-you-think-fac02fd575ad)).
