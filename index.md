## Hi! I'm Bryan!

I'm a [weather](https://bhlmn.github.io/wx.html)/stats geek who loves to learn and code.

Currently I am a Ph. D. candidate in [Dr. Steven Lazarus](http://www.fit.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?value=65)' meteorology [research group](http://coe.fit.edu/dmes/meteorology/research.php) at the [Florida Institute of Technology](http://www.fit.edu/). I study and implement statistical methods that improve the accuracy of wind forecasts.

During my studies I've become passionate about data management, big data capabilities, and solving problems with [machine learning](https://bhlmn.github.io/ml.html). After graduation I plan on pursuing a career in data science in my native Pacific Northwest.

## Projects

[**IRLWind**](https://github.com/bhlmn/IRLWind) - High resolution, operational, calibrated, probabilistic wind forecasting for the Indian River Lagoon.

[**IRLSetup**](https://bhlmn.github.io/IRLSetup/) - Operational, ensemble-based, probabilistic wind setup forecasting for the Indian River Lagoon.

[**WindVerification**](https://github.com/bhlmn/WindVerification) - R Package to process and verify wind forecasts from weather models.

**IRLFetch** - Wind fetch-based statistical bias correction and downscaling of wind speed forecasts over water bodies too small to be seen by weather models. Submitted to _Weather and Forecasting_.

**Languages**: R, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Matlab, bash, csh, Fortran

**Software/Frameworks**: Tableau, Geographic Information Systems, Unix/Linux, Command Line, Spark, Git, Microsoft Office, LaTeX, Numerical Modeling

**Statistical Techniques**: Classification (k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forests), Prediction (Multivariate/Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVMs, Gene Expression Programming), Clustering (k-means, fuzzy c-means)
