## Hi! I'm Bryan!

I'm a weather/stats geek who loves to learn and code.

Currently I am a Ph. D. candidate in Dr. Steven Lazarus' coastal winds research group at the Florida Institute of Technology. I study and implement statistical methods aimed at improving wind forecasts.

During my studies I've become passionate about data management, big data capabilities, and solving problems with machine learning. After graduation I plant on pursuing a career in data science in my native Pacific Northwest.

## Projects

* [**IRLWind**](https://github.com/bhlmn/IRLWind) - High resolution, operational, calibrated, probabilistic wind forecasting for the Indian River Lagoon.

* [**IRLSetup**](https://bhlmn.github.io/IRLSetup/) - Operational, ensemble-based, probabilistic wind setup forecasting for the Indian River Lagoon.

* [**WindVerification**](https://github.com/bhlmn/WindVerification) - R Package to process and verify wind forecasts from weather models.

* **IRLFetch** - [Wind fetch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_(geography))-based statistical bias correction and downscaling of wind speed forecasts over water bodies too small to be seen by weather models. Submitted to _Weather and Forecasting_.

## Skills

I use R every day, but throughout my graduate studies and dissertation work I've become comfortable with the following:

**Languages**: R, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bash, csh, Matlab
**Software**: Tableau, LaTeX, Geographic Information Systems, Git, Microsoft Office, Unix/Linux, Mac OS
**Statistical Techniques**: Classification (k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forests), Prediction (Multivariate/Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVMs, Gene Expression), Clustering (k-means, fuzzy c-means)
