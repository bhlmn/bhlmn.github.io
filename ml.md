Since I want to go into data science, I am *extremely* interested in Machine Learning. And with my background in meteorology, I am particularly interested in how machine learning methods have been applied in the meteorological field.

This page categorizes the machine learning methods I have studied, thanks to the books (Machine Learning with R)[https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Second-Brett-Lantz/dp/1784393908/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=8MQDWKS4ZKTNVKX2HNAH] and (Python Machine Learning)[https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1477502703&sr=1-1&keywords=python+machine+learning], as well as several pages on (GitHub)[https://github.com/] and (Stack Overflow)[http://stackoverflow.com/]. Lastly, I've found lots of value in Siraj Raval's Youtube channel, (Sirajology)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A].

Within each branch of machine learning method I include papers I've checked out that apply said method.

## Classification methods

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

### Naive Bayes

### Decision Trees

### Random Forests

### Rule Learners

## Prediction methods

### Regression Models

### Regression Trees

### Model Trees

### Neural Networks

* Uses
  + Short-term wind speed prediction ((Salcedo-Sanz et al. 2009)[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096014810800390X])

### Support Vector Machines

## Unsupervised methods

### Association Rules

### (k-means Clustering)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering]

* Variants
  + (Fuzzy c-means)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_clustering#Fuzzy_C-means_Clustering] (probabilistic)
  + (k-medioids)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids] & (k-PAM)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids#Algorithms] (cluster centers must be data points)

* Uses
  + Climate classification ((Zscheischler et al. 2012)[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050912002177])
