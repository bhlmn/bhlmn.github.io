My name is Bryan. I'm a P.h. D. candidate of Environmental Science at the Florida Institute of Technology. I'm a weather nerd, I enjoy spending time with my wife and kids, and I blog about R and data science.

I believe that teaching is the best way to learn, so I created this site to teach myself new R concepts and help others learn R.

## What I've Done

I made [PotentialWind](https://github.com/bhlmn/PotentialWind), an R package that calculates 10-m equivalent wind speeds of wind observations, useful for data analysis and verification of wind forecasts.

## What I Use

I work with R in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

I stay up to date on R topics at [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/).

I've found the following books to be quite helpful:

* [R in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Action-Data-Analysis-Graphics/dp/1617291382/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)
* [Machine Learning with R](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Second-Brett-Lantz/dp/1784393908/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1471950378&sr=1-1&keywords=machine+learning+with+r)
* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [R Graphics Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449316956/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449316956&linkCode=as2&tag=cooforr09-20)
