  My name is Bryan. I'm a Ph. D. candidate at the Florida Institute of Technology. I watch clouds, play with my kids, and blog about R and data science.

I believe that teaching is the best way to learn, so I created this site to teach myself new R concepts and help others learn R.  Feel free to get in touch with me on the following platforms ...
