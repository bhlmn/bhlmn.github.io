      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a meteorologist turned data scientist.
In graduate school I studied how feature engineering and machine learning could improve wind forecastsâ€“picking up Python, R, SQL, and data science along the way.
After graduate school I joined Kyruus Health, where I dove into data engineering, the cloud (GCP and AWS), dbt, and people/project leadership.
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m an AI Architect at Insight, where I design and build AI/ML-powered applications.
From five to nine I&amp;rsquo;m spending time with my amazing family, working out, playing sports, listening to instrumental rock, drumming, and enjoying all the Pacific Northwest has to offer.</description>

      <description>Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned during my career has been through on-the-job learning or self-study. The internet has a wealth of valuable content, one just needs to know where to find it.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ve collected the resources to which I refer the most.
Data analysis Packages:
Pandas for data analysis plotly for data visualization Data engineering Documentation:
dbt&amp;rsquo;s best practices GoogleSQL reference for BigQuery Machine learning/AI Courses:
Machine Learning Engineer learning path with Google Cloud Documentation:</description>
