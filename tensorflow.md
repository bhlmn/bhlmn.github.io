title: Teach Me TensorFlow
---

In March of 2019 TensorFlow released version [2.0 alpha](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha). A TensorFlow dabbler over the previous two years, I decided that 2019 would be the year I would learn its capabilities and use cases. _Teach Me TensorFlow_ is a course I am writing for my past self. My hope is it will help you learn this rich machine learning platform.

### Tutorials

These are designed to guide your TensorFlow journey from naive to proficient. Begin with the first and progress from there.

1. Why TensorFlow?
2. Setting up your TensorFlow 2.0 environment with `conda` and `pip`.

### Future tutorials

I'm still working on getting these production ready! Note that they are in no particular order.

* tf.estimators
* tf.data
* tensorflow_datasets
* Dataset API

* tf.keras
* Serving TensorFlow models with Flask
* Serving models on Cloud ML Engine using a serving input function
* TensorFlow Hub
* TensorBoard
* TensorFlow Probability

[//]: # (A way to introduce tf.data.Datasets and tf.keras.layers is by extending tf.estimator. Introduce a basic estimator, then ask what we do when we don't have enough memory? That's where tf.data.Datasets comes in. One of the basic estimator models not working for you? Let's get more detailed with out neural network architecture by introducing tf.keras.layers!)
